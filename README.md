# SimpleChatApp
A simple chat app that allows 2 people to talk to each other. No phone numbers are necessary. Just register with your email and it should be good.
This project uses Firebase to store the text messages and to authenticate the users. I used this as an intro to Firebase project because it helped me learn how Firebase works and how you can save/retrieve data from it and authentication.
This was created in my 1st month of Android Studio in August.
